# Contributing

SneakyPanel does not accept Pull Requests (PRs) for new functionality from users who are not part of the core project team. It has become overwhelming to allocate the necessary time and attention that complex PRs require and deserve. Therefore, to maintain the project's quality, we limit the scope of new functionality to work done by the core project team.

PRs that address existing bugs, along with a corresponding issue opened in our issue tracker, will continue to be accepted and reviewed. These PRs typically have a more focused scope and aim to improve upon existing, well-defined logic.
