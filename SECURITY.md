## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it directly to any project team member on [Discord](https://discord.gg/3b9bcWeM).

We strive to respond promptly; however, it may take one to two days for us to internally assess the report and its severity. **Please do not** use public channels or GitHub issues to report sensitive security matters.

As part of our response process, we will create a security advisory for the affected versions and disclose it publicly, usually two to four weeks after releasing a version that addresses the vulnerability.
